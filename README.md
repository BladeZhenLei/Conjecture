## Prime Partition
### Prime as n-1
<strong> 1. Mersenne Prime Conjecture </strong>
<br/>
There exist infinitely many primes in the form $2^k-1$.
<br/>
<strong> Comment </strong>
<br/>
Extremely difficult to prove, by far there are only 51 Mersenne primes found.
<p/>

<strong> 2. Catalan-Mersenne Prime Conjecture </strong>
<br/>
A sequence $\lbrace p_1, p_2, p_3, ..., p_n \rbrace$ where
$p_1=2^2-1,$
$p_2=2^{2^2-1}-1,$ 
$p_3=2^{2^{2^2-1}-1}-1,$
$p_4=2^{2^{2^{2^2-1}-1}-1}-1,...,$
it is conjectured that all elements of such sequence are primes.
<br/>
<strong> Comment </strong>
<br/>
This is a special case of the Mersenne Prime Conjecture. It holds for $p_1$ to $p_4$, but calculating $p_5$ would already be exceedingly large, let alone proving it.

<strong> 3. 2p-1 Conjecture </strong>
<br>
There exist infinitely many prime pairs such that $p$ is prime and $2p-1$ is also prime.
<br/>
<strong> Comment </strong>
<br/>
This is one form of the Cunningham Chain. It has to do with a particular type of $6k+1$ prime density.

### Prime as n+1
<strong> 4. Fermat Prime Conjecture </strong>
<br/>
There exist infinitely many primes in the form $2^k+1$.
<br/>
<strong> Comment </strong>
<br/>
More difficult than the Mersenne Prime Conjecture. There are only 5 Fermat primes found.
<p/>

<strong> 5. Sophie Germain Prime Conjecture </strong>
<br>
There exist infinitely many prime pairs such that $p$ is prime and $2p+1$ is also prime.
<br/>
<strong> Comment </strong>
<br/>
Another form of the Cunningham Chain. It has to do with a particular type of $6k-1$ prime density.

## Prime Gap
### 2-tuple
<strong> 6. Polignac's Conjecture </strong>
<br/>
All elements in the set of even numbers {2, 4, 6, ...} can be expressed as difference of infinitely many consecutive primes. In other words, there exist infinitely many 2-tuple $(0,k)$ where $k$ takes all even numbers.
<br/>
<strong> Comment </strong>
<br/>
None.  
<p/>
  
<strong> 7. Twin Prime Conjecture </strong>
<br/>
The unique adimissible 2-tuple $(0,2)$ as difference of primes are infinitely many, in other words, there exist infinitely many consectutive two primes in the pattern $(p, p+2)$. 
<br/>
<strong> Comment </strong>
<br/>
This is a special case of the Polignac's Conjecture. The closest result is from Yitang Zhang (2013) where he showed at least one 2-tuple which matches infinitely many positions; subsequent work showed that some 2-tuple exists with values differing by 246 or less that matches infinitely many positions.

## Integer Partition
### 2-partition
<strong> 9. Goldbach Conjecture </strong>
<br/>
Every even number $\geq{6}$ can be written as the sum of two prime numbers.
<br/>
<strong>Comment</strong>
<br/>
The closest result is from Jingrun Chen (1973), he proved that every sufficiently large even number can be written as the sum of either two primes, or a prime and a semiprime (the product of two primes).
This concerns the 2-partition of integers. Might be related to the n-partition (Gumbel) distribution?
