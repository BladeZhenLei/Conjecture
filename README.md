# Prime Partition
## Prime as n-1
### 1. Mersenne Prime Conjecture
There exist infinitely many primes in the form $2^k-1$.
<p/>
<strong> Comment </strong>
<br/>
Extremely difficult to prove, by far there are only 51 Mersenne primes found.

### 2. (sub-problem) Catalan-Mersenne Prime Conjecture
The sequence $\lbrace p_1, p_2, p_3, ..., p_n \rbrace$ where
$p_1=2^2-1,$
$p_2=2^{2^2-1}-1,$ 
$p_3=2^{2^{2^2-1}-1}-1,$
$p_4=2^{2^{2^{2^2-1}-1}-1}-1,...,$
is conjectured to have all its elements as primes.
<p/>
<strong> Comment </strong>
<br/>
This is a special case of the Mersenne Prime Conjecture. It holds for $p_1$ to $p_4$, but calculating $p_5$ would already be exceedingly large, let alone proving it.

###  3. 2p-1 Conjecture
There exist infinitely many prime pairs such that $p$ is prime and $2p-1$ is also prime.
<p/>
<strong> Comment </strong>
<br/>
This is one form of the Cunningham Chain. It has to do with a particular type of $6k+1$ prime density.

## Prime as n+1
### 4. Fermat Prime Conjecture
There exist infinitely many primes in the form $2^k+1$.
<p/>
<strong> Comment </strong>
<br/>
More difficult than the Mersenne Prime Conjecture. There are only 5 Fermat primes found.
<p/>

### 5. Sophie Germain Prime Conjecture
There exist infinitely many prime pairs such that $p$ is prime and $2p+1$ is also prime.
<p/>
<strong> Comment </strong>
<br/>
Another form of the Cunningham Chain. It has to do with a particular type of $6k-1$ prime density.

# Prime Gap
## 2-tuple
### 6. Polignac's Conjecture
All elements in the set of even numbers {2, 4, 6, ...} can be expressed as difference of infinitely many consecutive primes. In other words, there exist infinitely many 2-tuple $(0,k)$ where $k$ takes all even numbers.
<p/>
<strong> Comment </strong>
<br/>
None.  
<p/>
  
### 7. (sub-problem) Twin Prime Conjecture
The unique adimissible 2-tuple $(0,2)$ as difference of primes are infinitely many, in other words, there exist infinitely many consectutive two primes in the pattern $(p, p+2)$. 
<p/>
<strong> Comment </strong>
<br/>
The closest result is from Yitang Zhang (2013) where he showed at least one 2-tuple which matches infinitely many positions; subsequent work showed that some 2-tuple exists with values differing by 246 or less that matches infinitely many positions.

# Integer Partition
## 2-partition
### 9. Goldbach Conjecture
Every even number $\geq{6}$ can be written as the sum of two prime numbers.
<p/>
<strong>Comment</strong>
<br/>
The closest result is from Jingrun Chen (1973), he proved that every sufficiently large even number can be written as the sum of either two primes, or a prime and a semiprime (the product of two primes). 
<br/>
This concerns the 2-partition of the set even integers, it might be related to the n-partition (Gumbel) distribution.
