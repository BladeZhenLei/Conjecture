<strong> Catalan-Mersenne Prime Conjecture (open) </strong>
<br/>
A sequence $\lbrace p_1, p_2, p_3, ..., p_n \rbrace$ where
$p_1=2^2-1=3,$
$p_2=2^{2^2-1}-1=7,$ 
$p_3=2^{2^{2^2-1}-1}-1=127,$
$p_4=2^{2^{2^{2^2-1}-1}-1}-1=170141183460469231731687303715884105727,...,$
it is conjectured that all elements of such sequence are primes.

<strong> Comment </strong>
<br/>
Calculating $p_5$ would already be exceedingly large, it is impossible to do so with conventional computer or algorithm. However, there are some primality tests which do not require calculation of the number itself. Still, it is extremely hard to prove the statement algebraically.

<strong> 2p-1 Conjecture (open) </strong>
<br>
There exist infinitely many prime pairs such that $p$ is prime and $2p-1$ is also prime.

<br/>
<strong> Comment </strong>

<strong> Sophie Germain Prime Conjecture (open) </strong>
<br>
There exist infinitely many prime pairs such that $p$ is prime and $2p+1$ is also prime.
<br/>
<strong> Comment </strong>
<br/>
None.

## Prime Gap
### 2-tuple
<strong> Polignac's Conjecture (open) </strong>
<br/>
All elements in the set of even numbers {2, 4, 6, ..., n} can be expressed as difference of infinitely many consecutive primes. In other words, there exist infinitely many 2-tuple $(0,k)$ where $k$ takes all even numbers.

<strong> Comment </strong>
<br/>
None.

<strong> Twin Prime Conjecture (open) </strong>
<br/>
The unique adimissible 2-tuple $(0,2)$ as difference of primes are infinitely many, in other words, there exist infinitely many consectutive two primes in the pattern $(p, p+2)$. 
<br/>
<strong> Comment </strong>
<br/>
The closest result is from Yitang Zhang (2013) where he showed at least one 2-tuple which matches infinitely many positions; subsequent work showed that some 2-tuple exists with values differing by 246 or less that matches infinitely many positions.

### 3-tuple
<strong> My Conjecture (open) </strong>
<br/>
The unique admissible 3-tuples $(0,4,10)$ and $(0,10,4)$ as difference of primes are conjectued to be finitely many, in other words, there exist finitely many consectutive three primes in the pattern $(p, p+4, p+10)$.
<br/>
<strong>Comment</strong>
<br/>
There has been no observation of such prime gap for the first $10^9$ primes, meaning such rare case may be finite or non-existent. Could this somehow imply a counterexample to the First Hardy-Littlewood Conjecture?
