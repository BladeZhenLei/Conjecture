## Prime as Power of Integers

### 1. Prime Tower I (Catalan-Mersenne Prime Conjecture; open)
A sequence $\lbrace p_1, p_2, p_3, ..., p_n \rbrace$ where
$p_1=2^2-1=3,$
$p_2=2^{2^2-1}-1=7,$ 
$p_3=2^{2^{2^2-1}-1}-1=127,$
$p_4=2^{2^{2^{2^2-1}-1}-1}-1=170141183460469231731687303715884105727,...,$
it is conjectured that all elements of such sequence are primes. However, calculating $p_5$ would already be exceedingly large, it is impossible to do so with conventional computers. 
<p/>

### 2. Prime Tower II (My Conjecture; disproved)
A sequence $\lbrace p_1, p_2, p_3, ..., p_n \rbrace$ where
$p_1=2+3=5,$
$p_2=2^{2}+3^{3}=31,$
$p_3={2^2}^{2}+{3^3}^{3}=7625597485003,...,$
it was conjectured that all elements of such sequence are primes.

<strong>Proof:</strong> The original question was posted by me on a Chinese academic forum, the author who solved this problem has spent months on it and has paid cloud computation to find the smallest prime factor.

## Admissible k-Tuples

### 1. Prime 2-Tuple I (Twin Prime Conjecture; open)
The unique adimissible 2-tuple $(0,2)$ as difference of primes are infinitely many, in other words, there exist infinitely many consectutive two primes in the pattern $(p, p+2)$.


### 2. Prime 3-Tuple II (My Conjecture; open)
The unique admissible 3-tuples $(0,4,10)$ and $(0,10,4)$ as difference of primes are conjectued to be infinitely many (First Hardy-Littlewood Conjecture), in other words, there exist infinitely many consectutive three primes in the pattern $(p, p+4, p+10)$.
<br/>
However, there has been no observation of such prime gap for the first $10^9$ primes, could this somehow imply (algebraically) a counterexample?
