## Prime as n-1
### 1. Mersenne Prime Conjecture
There exist infinitely many primes in the form $2^k-1$.
<p/>
<strong> Comment </strong>
<br/>
Extremely difficult to prove, by far there are only 51 Mersenne primes found.

### 2. (sub-problem) Catalan-Mersenne Prime Conjecture
The sequence $\lbrace p_1, p_2, p_3, ..., p_n \rbrace$ where
$p_1=2^2-1,$
$p_2=2^{2^2-1}-1,$ 
$p_3=2^{2^{2^2-1}-1}-1,$
$p_4=2^{2^{2^{2^2-1}-1}-1}-1,...,$
is conjectured to have all its elements as primes.

<strong> Comment </strong>
<br/>
This is a special case of the Mersenne Prime Conjecture. It holds for $p_1$ to $p_4$, but calculating $p_5$ would already be exceedingly large, let alone proving it.

###  3. 2p-1 Conjecture
There exist infinitely many prime pairs such that $p$ is prime and $2p-1$ is also prime.

This is one form of the Cunningham Chain. It has to do with a particular type of $6k+1$ prime density.

## Prime as n+1
### 4. Fermat Prime Conjecture
There exist infinitely many primes in the form $2^k+1$.
<p/>
<strong> Comment </strong>
<br/>
More difficult than the Mersenne Prime Conjecture. There are only 5 Fermat primes found.
<p/>

### 5. Sophie Germain Prime Conjecture
There exist infinitely many prime pairs such that $p$ is prime and $2p+1$ is also prime.
<p/>
<strong> Comment </strong>
<br/>
Another form of the Cunningham Chain. It has to do with a particular type of $6k-1$ prime density.
