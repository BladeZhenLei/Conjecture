## Prime Partition
### p=n-1
<strong> 1. Mersenne Prime Conjecture </strong>
<br/>
There exist infinitely many primes in the form $2^k-1$.
<br/>
<strong> Comment </strong>
<br/>
Extremely difficult to prove, by far there are only 51 Mersenne primes found.
<p/>

<strong> 2. Catalan-Mersenne Prime Conjecture </strong>
<br/>
A sequence $\lbrace p_1, p_2, p_3, ..., p_n \rbrace$ where
$p_1=2^2-1=3,$
$p_2=2^{2^2-1}-1=7,$ 
$p_3=2^{2^{2^2-1}-1}-1=127,$
$p_4=2^{2^{2^{2^2-1}-1}-1}-1=170141183460469231731687303715884105727,...,$
it is conjectured that all elements of such sequence are primes.
<br/>
<strong> Comment </strong>
<br/>
This is a special case of the Mersenne Prime Conjecture. Calculating $p_5$ would already be exceedingly large.

<strong> 3. 2p-1 Conjecture </strong>
<br>
There exist infinitely many prime pairs such that $p$ is prime and $2p-1$ is also prime.
<br/>
<strong> Comment </strong>
<br/>
This is one form of the Cunningham Chain. It has to do with a particular type of $6k+1$ prime density.

### p=n+1
<strong> 4. Fermat Prime Conjecture </strong>
<br/>
There exist infinitely many primes in the form $2^k+1$.
<br/>
<strong> Comment </strong>
<br/>
More difficult than the Mersenne Prime Conjecture. There are only 5 Fermat primes found.
<p/>

<strong> 5. Sophie Germain Prime Conjecture </strong>
<br>
There exist infinitely many prime pairs such that $p$ is prime and $2p+1$ is also prime.
<br/>
<strong> Comment </strong>
<br/>
Another form of the Cunningham Chain. It has to do with a particular type of $6k-1$ prime density.

## Prime Gap
### 2-tuple
<strong> 6. Polignac's Conjecture </strong>
<br/>
All elements in the set of even numbers {2, 4, 6, ..., n} can be expressed as difference of infinitely many consecutive primes. In other words, there exist infinitely many 2-tuple $(0,k)$ where $k$ takes all even numbers.
<br/>
<strong> Comment </strong>
<br/>
None.  
<p/>
  
<strong> 7. Twin Prime Conjecture </strong>
<br/>
The unique adimissible 2-tuple $(0,2)$ as difference of primes are infinitely many, in other words, there exist infinitely many consectutive two primes in the pattern $(p, p+2)$. 
<br/>
<strong> Comment </strong>
<br/>
This is a special case of the Polignac's Conjecture. The closest result is from Yitang Zhang (2013) where he showed at least one 2-tuple which matches infinitely many positions; subsequent work showed that some 2-tuple exists with values differing by 246 or less that matches infinitely many positions.

### 3-tuple
<strong> 8. My Conjecture </strong>
<br/>
The unique admissible 3-tuples $(0,4,10)$ and $(0,10,4)$ as difference of primes are conjectued to be finitely many, in other words, there exist finitely many consectutive three primes in the pattern $(p, p+4, p+10)$.
<br/>
<strong>Comment</strong>
<br/>
There has been no observation of such prime gap for the first $10^9$ primes, meaning such rare case may be finite or non-existent. Could this somehow imply a counterexample to the First Hardy-Littlewood Conjecture?
<p/>

## Integer Partition
### 2-partition
<strong> 9. Goldbach Conjecture </strong>
<br/>
Every prime $\geq{6}$ can be written as the sum of two even numbers.
<br/>
<strong>Comment</strong>
<br/>
This concerns the 2-partition of integers. Might be related to the n-partition (Gumbel) distribution?
