## Prime as Power of Integers

### Prime Tower I (Catalan-Mersenne Prime Conjecture; open)
A sequence $\lbrace p_1, p_2, p_3, ..., p_n \rbrace$ where
$p_1=2^2-1=3,$
$p_2=2^{2^2-1}-1=7,$ 
$p_3=2^{2^{2^2-1}-1}-1=127,$
$p_4=2^{2^{2^{2^2-1}-1}-1}-1=170141183460469231731687303715884105727,...,$
it is conjectured that all elements of such sequence are primes.
<p/>
<strong>Some Thoughts</strong>
<br/>
Calculating $p_5$ would already be exceedingly large, it is impossible to do so with conventional computer or algorithm. However, there are some primality tests which do not require calculation of the number itself. Still, it is extremely hard to prove the statement algebraically.
<p/>

### Prime Tower II (My Conjecture; disproved)
A sequence $\lbrace p_1, p_2, p_3, ..., p_n \rbrace$ where
$p_1=2+3=5,$
$p_2=2^{2}+3^{3}=31,$
$p_3={2^2}^{2}+{3^3}^{3}=7625597485003,...,$
it was conjectured that all elements of such sequence are primes.
<p/>

<strong>Proof</strong>
<br/>
The original question was posted by me on a Chinese academic forum, the author who solved this problem has spent months on it and has paid cloud computation to find the smallest prime factor.

## Admissible k-Tuples

### Prime 2-Tuple I (Twin Prime Conjecture; open)
The unique adimissible 2-tuple $(0,2)$ as difference of primes are infinitely many, in other words, there exist infinitely many consectutive two primes in the pattern $(p, p+2)$. 
<p/>
<strong>Partial Result</strong>
<br/>
The newest result is from Yitang Zhang (2013) where he showed at least one 2-tuple which matches infinitely many positions; subsequent work showed that some 2-tuple exists with values differing by 246 or less that matches infinitely many positions.


### Prime 3-Tuple II (My Conjecture; open)
The unique admissible 3-tuples $(0,4,10)$ and $(0,10,4)$ as difference of primes are conjectued to be infinitely many, in other words, there exist infinitely many consectutive three primes in the pattern $(p, p+4, p+10)$.
<p/>
<strong>Some Thoughts</strong>
<br>
There has been no observation of such prime gap for the first $10^9$ primes, could this somehow imply a counterexample to the First Hardy-Littlewood Conjecture?
