## Prime as Power of Integers
### 1. Prime Tower I (Catalan-Mersenne Prime Conjecture; open)
A sequence $\lbrace p_1, p_2, p_3, ..., p_n \rbrace$ where
$p_1=2^2-1=3,$
$p_2=2^{2^2-1}-1=7,$ 
$p_3=2^{2^{2^2-1}-1}-1=127,$
$p_4=2^{2^{2^{2^2-1}-1}-1}-1=170141183460469231731687303715884105727,$
$p_5=2^{2^{2^{2^{2^2-1}-1}-1}-1}-1=?, ...,$
it is conjectured that all elements of such sequence are primes.
<p/>

### 2. Prime Tower II (My Conjecture; disproved)
A sequence $\lbrace p_1, p_2, p_3, ..., p_n \rbrace$ where
$p_1=2+3=5,$
$p_2=2^{2}+3^{3}=31,$
$p_3={2^2}^{2}+{3^3}^{3}=7625597485003,$
$p_4=2^{{2^2}^{2}}+3^{{3^3}^{3}}=?,...,$
it <strong>was</strong> conjectured that all elements of such sequence are primes.

<strong>Answer:</strong> The original question and answer were posted by me on the Chinese academic forum <strong>Zhihu</strong>, the author who solved the problem has spent one month on it with paid cloud computation to find the smallest factor.

## Admissible k-Tuples

### Prime 2-Tuple I(Twin Prime Conjecture; open)
The unique adimissible 2-tuple $(0,2)$ as difference of primes are infinitely many, in other words, there exist infinitely many consectutive <strong>two</strong> primes in the pattern $(p, p+4, p+10)$.


### Prime 3-Tuple II(My Conjecture; open)
The unique admissible 3-tuples $(0,4,10)$ and $(0,10,4)$ as difference of primes are conjectued to be infinitely many (First Hardy-Littlewood Conjecture), in other words, there exist infinitely many consectutive <strong>three</strong> primes in the pattern $(p, p+4, p+10)$.
<br/>
However, there has been no observation of such prime gap for the first $10^9$ primes, could this somehow imply (algebraically) a counterexample?
